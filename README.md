Backrow questionaire draft.
 ## Given the software project (Permit to Work System) discussed in class, your group project will be to construct a Requirements Document for this software.
 
**1.  There are two drafts of this document due:**

> * initial draft on Thursday, Nov 15
> * final draft on Thursday, Dec 4

**2.  Each group will also be asked to peer review the document of another team (to be determined later) as a portion of your group project grade**

**3.  The Requirements Document should contain the following information:**

> * (a)  A questionnaire to complete requirements
> * (b)  A textual/prose description of the software system, as means to introduce the software concept and set the 
> context for the following information.  Use appropriate chapters of the Vision Document
> * (c)  User Stories for all uses of the software product
> * (d)  An Analysis model of the system, visually depicting the system objects and capabilities in a UML Class
> * (e)  Diagram and non-trivial UML Sequence Diagrams. You can use Lucidcharts (https://www.lucidchart.com)
> * (f)  Mock  UI  designs  of  typical  software  screens  to  help  visualize  a  possible  system  and
> illustrate critical portions of the software's capabilities.  Mock UIs are required for possible screen/interface of the 
> software. Use Adobe XD for this purpose
> * (g)  Description of non-functional requirements that cannot be reasonably included as part of User Stories

**4.  GitHub link for the initial and final draft of the Requirements Document is available on Canvas.**
